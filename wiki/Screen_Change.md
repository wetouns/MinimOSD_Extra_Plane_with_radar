# Setting screen change mode #

You can choose from 3 different ways of switching.

Also if you don't need this function you can turn it off.


1./ By mode switch:

You select "Mode Switch" in OSD Toggle Channel drop-down menu.

If you don't have any free channel for screen switching you can use your mode switch to do so.
It works this way: If you switch from a mode to another than back, within 2 sec, than will jump to the next screen. (except RTL and Circle) if you do it again than it will turn osd off, if again than will show the first screen again. (so this is a kind of rotation switching.) This is the normal behaviour. But!
If you just booted your system and the timer shows less than 60 sec than by switching screens you enter to config menu instead.
There is another thing that modifies the behaviour. That is warnings. If there is any active warning, than OSD will jump back to screen 1 and stay there. (If you want to test switching at home, than you can turn warnings off, so you can try.)


2./
Real switching:
For this you need a N position switch or rotary knob assigned to the channel you set in Config. Tool "OSD Toggle Channel" drop-down menu. Leave the "Rotation Switching" check-box unchecked.

In this mode switching will work like this:
Every position of your N position switch is assigned to a screen. Screen 1 is one end, and Setup screen is the other. It is up to your radio. (If your channel is reversed or not)

3./
Switching by a momentary switch:
For this you need a momentary switch (like trainer switch) assigned to the channel you set in Config. Tool "OSD Toggle Channel" drop-down menu. And check the "Rotation Switching" check-box.


You select any channel you want to use from 5 to 8, than check Rotation Switching check-box. Also you can select switching by extermal PWM, connected to  "PAL" jumper

This mode is also a rotation switching way of changing screens like by mode switch.
The difference is that you have a separate switch to do so.
It works this way:
You push/pull than release. It brings you to next screen than you push/pull than release sot it gets you to screen off, than again and screen 1 again.
